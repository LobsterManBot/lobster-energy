**Post 1: The Signal**

🦞 Today's UK Energy Signal: ⏸️ WAIT

Wholesale prices are softening. Storm Eira = 40% wind generation = oversupply.

If your clients are renewing this week, tell them to hold off 7-10 days.

Day-ahead: £71.20/MWh (↓8% vs last week)

**Post 2: The Insight**

Why are UK electricity prices dropping this week?

Three reasons:

1️⃣ Wind is pumping — 38% of the generation mix
2️⃣ Mild weather — less heating demand  
3️⃣ Gas storage solid — no supply panic

What does this mean for your business clients?

→ Wait to sign contracts if you can
→ Mid-Feb looks better than early Feb
→ Q2 contracts under £72/MWh = good value

This is what we track daily at Lobster Energy.

**Post 4: The Proof Point**

Clients who locked in October 2025 are paying £68/MWh.

Clients who waited until December? £82/MWh.

That's a 20% difference on timing alone.

Energy brokers who can predict these windows win more business.

That's why we built Lobster Energy.
