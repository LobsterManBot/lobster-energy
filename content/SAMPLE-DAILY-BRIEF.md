## Today's Signal: ⏸️ WAIT

**Don't lock in contracts this week.** Wholesale prices are elevated but softening indicators suggest better rates in 7-14 days.

---

## What's Moving Prices

### 📉 Bearish (prices likely to fall)
- **Wind output surging** — Storm Eira bringing 40%+ wind generation through Monday
- **Demand dropping** — Mild temperatures forecast (8-11°C) reduces heating load
- **Gas storage healthy** — EU storage at 52%, above seasonal average

### 📈 Bullish (upward pressure)
- **Carbon prices firm** — EUA trading at €74, up 3% this week
- **Interconnector maintenance** — IFA2 (France link) offline until 15 Feb

### ⚖️ Net View
Short-term bearish. High renewables + mild weather = oversupply this weekend. Expect day-ahead to dip below £65/MWh.
