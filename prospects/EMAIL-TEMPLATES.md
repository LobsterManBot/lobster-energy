# Cold Email Templates for Lenny 🦞

## Template 1: The Direct Pitch

**Subject:** Helping [Company] clients time the energy market

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Quick question - do your clients ever ask "when's the best time to lock in our energy contract?"

We've built something that answers that. Lobster Energy uses BMRS data and machine learning to generate buy/wait signals for the UK electricity market. Our backtests show ~4% savings vs buying at random times.

A few TPIs are already using it to:
- Give clients data-backed timing advice
- Add credibility to renewal conversations  
- Stand out from "we'll get you quotes" competitors

Happy to give you a free trial if you're curious.

Cheers,
Lenny

## Template 2: The Credibility Angle

**Subject:** Something for your client pitches

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Noticed [Company] works with SMEs on business energy - nice work on [recent win/award/news if findable].

Random thought: would a "UK Energy Market Brief" be useful for your client conversations? We publish weekly forecasts and trading signals based on official grid data.

Some brokers white-label our reports for client packs. Makes "we watch the market for you" actually tangible.

Want me to send a sample?

## Template 3: The Pain Point

**Subject:** The Bionic problem

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Bionic keeps talking about being "tech-enabled" - but most of their tech is just form autofill.

Real tech would be: telling clients the exact week to sign their contract based on wholesale price forecasts.

We built that. It's called Lobster Energy.

If you want to out-tech the comparison giants, let's chat.

## Template 4: The Warm Referral (for after we have customers)

**Subject:** [Mutual Contact] suggested I reach out

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

[Referrer Name] at [Their Company] mentioned you might be interested in market timing tools.

We provide energy price signals and forecasts to TPIs - helps clients trust your "now's a good time to sign" advice with actual data.

[Referrer] has been using it for [X months] - happy to show you what they're seeing.

Free to chat this week?

## Template 5: The Event Follow-up (for after conferences)

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Was great chatting at [Event] - especially your point about [something they said].

If you want a proper demo, just reply and we'll set it up.

Cheers,
Lenny
