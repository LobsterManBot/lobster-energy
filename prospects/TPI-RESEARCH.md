# UK TPI / Energy Broker Research 🦞

*Last updated: 2026-02-08*

## What Are TPIs?

Third Party Intermediaries - businesses that help other businesses compare and switch energy suppliers. They earn commission from suppliers when they switch a customer.

**Why they need Lobster Energy:**
- They advise clients on WHEN to buy (timing the market)
- Better market intel = more trust = more clients
- Our signals could be their secret weapon

- Need: Something credible to point to

**Tertiary:** Founder of small TPI (1-10 people)

## Notes

- Bionic dominates with "tech" messaging - we can position as their data layer
- Many TPIs are regional - could segment outreach by geography
- The "Agency" tier with white-label reports could be very attractive to small brokers
